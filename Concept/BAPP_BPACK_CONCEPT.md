# BAPP BPack

## About

Short for Backup App data backpack, pronunciation under discussion, is a tool that keeps all system and normal program app data in a backpack that can be backed up once per session, and also before shutdown (prompting the user to backup before a repair) so that the device is immediately the same after a complete reinstall upon startup.

### As a SmartSwitch component

It will be a component of SmartSwitch.

### Platform support

Its current main platform is Ubuntu 20.04 (for my own needs) and Fedora 33. Development will be available for every other Linux distribution and Linux version, but these 2 versions will receive the most support for the time being.
